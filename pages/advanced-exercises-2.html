    <h1>Advanced Exercises II: Prompt Crafting</h1>
    <p>In the previous exercises, you were given a detailed list of requirements. Now, the roles are reversed. Your mission is to act as the creative director and project lead. For each exercise below, you will not be given a list of specific features. Instead, you must work with a conversational AI (like Gemini or ChatGPT) to design a cutting-edge, professional, and visually compelling webpage.</p>
    <p>Your primary task is to craft the perfect prompt. Use the AI as a brainstorming partner to define what an "advanced" version of each page looks like, and then synthesize those ideas into a single, detailed prompt for an AI to build the page.</p>
    <h2>Advanced Exercise 1: The Homepage</h2>
    <p><b>Filename:</b> exercises/advanced-1.html</p>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To design and specify a homepage that serves as a powerful and engaging introduction to an artist's entire portfolio.</p>
    <h3>Your Mission:</h3>
    <p>Work with a conversational AI to brainstorm and define the features of a cutting-edge homepage. Think beyond a simple welcome message. How can you immediately capture a visitor's attention? What makes a homepage feel modern and professional? Consider elements like hero sections, animations, custom cursors, or unique layouts. Once you have a clear vision, write a complete and detailed prompt for an AI to build the page.</p>
    <h2>Advanced Exercise 2: The Bio Page</h2>
    <p><b>Filename:</b> exercises/advanced-2.html</p>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To design and specify a biography page that tells the artist's story in a visually interesting and memorable way.</p>
    <h3>Your Mission:</h3>
    <p>Collaborate with a conversational AI to design an artist bio page that is more than just a block of text. How can the layout, typography, and imagery work together to reflect the artist's personality and work? Explore ideas like asymmetrical layouts, scroll-triggered effects, or interactive timelines. After defining your concept, write a complete and detailed prompt for an AI to build the page.</p>
    <h2>Advanced Exercise 3: The Gallery Page</h2>
    <p><b>Filename:</b> exercises/advanced-3.html</p>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To design and specify a main gallery page that provides an intuitive and elegant way for users to browse different collections of work.</p>
    <h3>Your Mission:</h3>
    <p>Use a conversational AI to imagine and plan a sophisticated main gallery page. Instead of a simple grid, consider more advanced navigation concepts. How can users move between different series of work? Could you use horizontal scrolling, animated transitions, or interactive filters? Your goal is to create a browsing experience that feels unique and engaging. Once your design is finalized, write a complete and detailed prompt for an AI to build the page.</p>
    <h2>Advanced Exercise 4: The Contact Page</h2>
    <p><b>Filename:</b> exercises/advanced-4.html</p>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To design and specify a contact page that is both functional and creatively aligned with the artist's brand.</p>
    <h3>Your Mission:</h3>
    <p>Work with a conversational AI to design a contact page that elevates a simple form into a well-designed experience. While the core functionality must be a working form using https://formsubmit.co/, consider the surrounding elements. How can you use layout, imagery, or micro-interactions to make the page feel polished and professional? After planning the page, write a complete and detailed prompt for an AI to build it.</p>
    <h2>Project Requirements (For All Four Exercises)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cohesive Design:</b> All four pages (advanced-1.html through advanced-4.html) must look and feel like they belong to the same website. They should share a consistent color palette, typography, and overall design aesthetic.</li>
        <li><b>Navigation:</b> Each page must include a consistent navigation bar that allows users to easily travel between all four pages.</li>
        <li><b>Core Principles:</b> Even though not explicitly listed here, your prompts must still instruct the AI to follow all the core principles from the class (detailed commenting, external CSS, relative paths, accessibility, etc.). It is your responsibility to remember and include these technical requirements in the prompts you create.</li>
