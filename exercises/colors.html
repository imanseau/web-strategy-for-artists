<!--
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named colors.html with a single heading and two buttons. Use a consistent brand-inspired color palette with at least three custom colors: one for the background of the page, one for the text color, and one for the button background color. Apply a hover effect that changes the button background to a complementary or contrasting color. Link to an external stylesheet at css/colors.css to handle all styling. Write neurotically detailed comments in both the HTML and CSS files â€” explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
