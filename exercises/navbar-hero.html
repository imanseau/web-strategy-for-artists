Prompt:
Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named navbar-hero.html with a horizontal <nav> bar fixed to the top of the screen. On the left side of the nav, include a branding element such as a site name or logo. On the right side, include navigation links for Home, Gallery, and Contact, along with a dropdown menu labeled “More” that contains two additional links. Link to an external CSS file (css/navbar-hero.css) that uses Flexbox to space the branding and navigation links appropriately. Make sure the dropdown menu is fully visible and not clipped, either off the screen or by other containers. Use absolute positioning below the triggering button, and apply enough top spacing so it clears the fixed navbar. Also ensure no parent element has overflow: hidden or overflow: auto that would interfere with the dropdown. Use a small amount of JavaScript in scripts/navbar-hero.js to toggle the visibility of the dropdown links when “More” is clicked. Below the navbar, create a full-height hero section with a background image located at images/hero.jpg. Center a large heading and a call-to-action button in the middle of the hero section using Flexbox. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Imagine you’re explaining every single line to a student who has never seen code before. Comment every tag, class, style rule, and JavaScript action. Explain what each line does, why it's used, and how it contributes to the layout or behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
