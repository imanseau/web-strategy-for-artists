<!-- 
  Create a complete HTML5 page named sticky-header.html with a sticky navigation header 
  that remains fixed to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls. 
  The header should contain a branding element on the left (such as a site name or logo), 
  and a simple navigation menu on the right with links to at least three in-page sections. 
  If you include a dropdown menu in the header (optional), make sure it is fully visible 
  and not clipped by overflow issues—use position: absolute for the dropdown and ensure 
  no parent container has overflow: hidden or overflow: auto that could cut it off. 
  Below the header, add at least three scrollable content sections (e.g., full-screen-height) 
  to demonstrate sticky behavior. Style everything using an external CSS file located at 
  css/sticky-header.css. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, 
  class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the 
  reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme 
  and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. 
  Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <h1>Origins of Abstract Expressionism</h1>
    <p>
      Emerging in 1940s New York, Abstract Expressionism marked a shift in artistic power
      from Europe to America. Influenced by surrealism, this movement emphasized subconscious
      creation and emotional intensity through bold brushwork and expansive canvases.

  <!-- Section 2: Another scrollable section -->
  <section id="section2" class="content-section">
    <h1>Key Figures in the Movement</h1>
    <p>
      Jackson Pollock's drip paintings, Mark Rothko’s color fields, and Willem de Kooning’s
      aggressive brushstrokes helped define the movement. Each artist brought a unique style,
      but shared a desire to break from traditional representation.
    </p>

  <!-- Section 3: Final scrollable section -->
  <section id="section3" class="content-section">
    <h1>Lasting Legacy</h1>
    <p>
      Abstract Expressionism paved the way for future contemporary art forms such as Minimalism
      and Conceptual Art. Its emphasis on process, gesture, and emotional resonance remains
      a cornerstone of modern art education and practice.
