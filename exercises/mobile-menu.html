<!--
  Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named mobile-menu.html that includes a mobile 
  navigation menu. The menu should be hidden by default and toggled by clicking a hamburger icon. 
  When toggled, a dropdown-style menu should appear, containing four navigation links. 
  Use JavaScript in scripts/mobile-menu.js to control the toggle behavior and handle 
  showing/hiding the menu. All visual styling and responsive layout should be written 
  in an external stylesheet located at css/mobile-menu.css. 
  Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, 
  and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. 
  Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. 
  Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. 
  Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

      <h1>Exploring Contemporary Installation Art</h1>
      <p>
        Installation art breaks the traditional confines of canvas and pedestal, inviting viewers into immersive,
        site-specific environments. From light-based sculptures to room-sized video works, this medium continues
        to challenge perception and redefine the gallery space.
