<!--
Create a complete HTML5 page named modal.html that displays a small thumbnail image loaded from images/gallery1.jpg. When clicked, this thumbnail should open a larger version of the same image in a centered modal popup with a dimmed background overlay. The modal must include a clearly visible close button (e.g., an “X” or a button labeled “Close”) that hides the modal when clicked. Clicking outside the image area should also close the modal. Use an external stylesheet at css/modal.css for all visual styling, and link to an external JavaScript file at scripts/modal.js to handle modal interactions. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
