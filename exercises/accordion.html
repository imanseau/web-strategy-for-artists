<!--
  Create a complete HTML5 page named accordion.html that displays an accordion interface 
  with at least three collapsible sections. Each section should have a clickable heading 
  that expands or collapses the associated content. Only one section should be open at a time. 
  Use semantic markup with <section> and <h3> elements for each accordion item. 
  Apply ARIA attributes like aria-expanded and aria-controls for accessibility. 
  Use external JavaScript in scripts/accordion.js to toggle the visibility state, 
  and external CSS in css/accordion.css to handle layout, spacing, and transition effects. 
  Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, ARIA role, 
  event listener, style rule, and animation decision as if you're teaching a complete beginner. 
  Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme, interactivity behavior, 
  and accessibility support. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. 
  Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
