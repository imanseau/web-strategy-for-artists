Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named basic.html. Add a centered <h1> heading and a short <p> paragraph. Link to an external CSS file (css/basic.css) that sets the background color to white and the text color to black. Write detailed comments in both the HTML and CSS files, as if you're teaching someone completely new to coding. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
