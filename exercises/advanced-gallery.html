<!--
You are an AI website generator. Generate a complete, responsive HTML5 gallery page named advanced-gallery.html, along with two linked external files:

css/advanced-gallery.css (for all visual styling)

scripts/advanced-gallery.js (for all modal functionality)

Follow the instructions below with precision:

Filename: advanced-gallery.html
Concept: This page displays a visually appealing, interactive gallery for a series of six artworks. The layout must be responsive, include hover overlays, and allow modal viewing of larger images.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Header and Footer:

Include a consistent <header> and <footer> section at the top and bottom of the page.

These may contain placeholder content like site title, nav links, or copyright.

Main Heading:

Inside the <main> section, include a prominent <h1> element with a placeholder title like “Artwork Series”.

Gallery Grid:

Below the heading, add a container element (such as <section class="gallery-grid">) that uses a responsive CSS Grid layout to display six images:

Images must be named gallery1.jpg through gallery6.jpg, and loaded from the images/ folder.

Each image must be wrapped in a <div class="gallery-item"> or similar, to apply hover effects and enable modal triggers.

Responsive Layout:

On desktop screens (width ≥ 1024px), the gallery must display as three columns.

On tablet screens (width between 768px and 1023px), it must display as two columns.

On mobile screens (width < 768px), it must collapse to a single column.

All responsive behavior must be handled using CSS media queries in css/advanced-gallery.css.

Hover Effects:

When hovering over a gallery image:

A semi-transparent overlay must appear over the image.

The overlay must contain a placeholder title (e.g., "Untitled #1").

Overlay and text must fade or slide in smoothly on hover using CSS transitions.

Modal (Lightbox) Functionality:

When any image is clicked:

A modal must open displaying a larger version of the selected image.

The modal must be:

Centered on the screen

Over a dimmed background overlay

The modal must include:

A visible “X” close button

The ability to close the modal by clicking anywhere outside the modal content

All modal functionality (open, close, background click detection) must be handled using JavaScript in scripts/advanced-gallery.js.

STYLING INSTRUCTIONS (css/advanced-gallery.css):

All layout styling (grid, responsiveness) and visual behavior (hover overlays, modal design, transitions) must be in this CSS file.

DO NOT include any inline or internal <style> blocks.

Use neurotically detailed CSS comments to explain:

Why each class/selector was used

The purpose of every rule and media query

The behavior controlled by each transition, hover, or layout property

SCRIPTING INSTRUCTIONS (scripts/advanced-gallery.js):

All modal functionality must be defined in this external JS file.

Use plain JavaScript (no external libraries).

Include:

Event listeners for image clicks

Functions to display the correct image in the modal

Functions to close the modal via "X" button or background click

Add neurotically detailed JavaScript comments explaining:

The role of each function and variable

Why specific DOM methods are used

How events are handled

COMMENTING RULES (ALL FILES):

You must use neurotically detailed comments throughout:

HTML: explain the purpose of every tag, class, and structural choice

CSS: explain every rule, value, selector, and layout behavior

JS: explain every line of code, function, variable, and event

Comments should be clear and educational, suitable for a beginner learning front-end development.

PROMPT ARCHIVING:

At the very top of the advanced-gallery.html file, include the entire text of this prompt inside an HTML comment block.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTION (links.html update):

After generating the new advanced-gallery.html page, update the existing links.html page by manually or programmatically adding a new link to it.

Add the following HTML to the bottom of the list of page links in links.html:

html

Edit
<!-- Link to the advanced gallery page -->
<a href="advanced-gallery.html" class="nav-button">Artwork Gallery</a>
If the links are inside a list, wrap this in a <li> tag or appropriate container.
