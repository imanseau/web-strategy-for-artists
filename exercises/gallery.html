Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named gallery.html that displays a grid of six images using CSS Grid. On desktop screens, show the images in a three-column layout; on smaller screens such as tablets or phones, collapse the layout to a single column. Add a hover effect to each image that either slightly scales the image up or applies a grayscale filter. All images should be stored in the images/ folder and styled using an external stylesheet at css/gallery.css. Use the following image filenames: images/gallery1.jpg, images/gallery2.jpg, images/gallery3.jpg, images/gallery4.jpg, images/gallery5.jpg, and images/gallery6.jpg. Comment your CSS layout choices and each hover effect clearly. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
