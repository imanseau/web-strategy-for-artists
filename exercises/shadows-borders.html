<!--
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named shadows-borders.html that displays three visually distinct content boxes side by side. Use CSS Flexbox to align them horizontally across the page. Each box should have a unique combination of border style (solid, dashed, or double) and box-shadow settings to suggest visual depth and separation. Link to an external stylesheet at css/shadows-borders.css to handle all layout and styling. Comment on each boxâ€™s visual treatment and how it contributes to a sense of hierarchy or depth. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
