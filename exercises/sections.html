    <p>
      Raku is a dramatic and unpredictable ceramics firing method rooted in 16th-century Japan. It emphasizes natural imperfections and embraces smoke, flame, and rapid cooling to create unique surface effects.

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      My Raku vessels are hand-thrown and bisque-fired, then glazed with copper-based formulas. They are pulled from the kiln while red-hot and placed into barrels with sawdust, creating bursts of carbonization and iridescent colors.
