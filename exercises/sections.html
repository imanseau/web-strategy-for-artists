<!-- 
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named sections.html with three stacked <section> blocks titled About, Work, and Contact. Link to an external CSS file (css/sections.css) that assigns each section a unique background color, adds padding, and centers the text. Write detailed comments in both the HTML and CSS files, as if you're teaching someone completely new to coding. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
