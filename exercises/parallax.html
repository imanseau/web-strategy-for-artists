Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named parallax.html that demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect using multiple sections. Use a combination of solid-colored and parallax-image sections to create clear visual contrast as the user scrolls. Structure the layout with the following sequence: (1) a solid background section with a large heading as the page title (let the height be auto based on content), (2) a parallax section using images/parallax.jpg set to 25% of the viewport height, (3) a solid section with a heading and at least three paragraphs discussing an art-related topic, (4) another parallax section at 10% viewport height, and (5) a final solid section with additional paragraph content. Style everything using css/parallax.css, and use background-attachment: fixed in the parallax sections. Ensure text is readable and well-padded. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <h2>The Tactility of Process</h2>
    <p>In recent decades, artists have turned increasingly to the process itself as a form of expression. Instead of concealing technique, they foreground it—using thick layers of paint, scorched canvas, broken ceramics, and raw textile remnants to tell stories of imperfection and vulnerability.</p>
    <p>This material-first approach shifts focus away from pristine outcomes. The act of making becomes the art, and every fingerprint, burn mark, or tear is embraced as part of the final piece. The result is deeply human, resisting industrial polish and inviting tactile engagement.</p>
    <p>By emphasizing decay and transformation, these works reflect the impermanence of physical forms. They become temporal documents—holding space for entropy as a creative force rather than a flaw.</p>

    <p>Through the use of unconventional materials and layered methods, contemporary artists are reclaiming messiness as meaning. This shift away from sterile perfection not only critiques mass production—it reaffirms the body’s role in creation and the intimacy of imperfection.</p>
