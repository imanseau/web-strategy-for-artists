Prompt:
Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named two-column.html with a main content area divided into two side-by-side columns using either CSS Flexbox or Grid. One column should include text content about an art-related topic, and the other should include an image from images/sample.jpg. Ensure the layout automatically collapses to a single-column layout on smaller screen sizes (such as tablets or phones). Link to an external CSS file at css/two-column.css to handle all visual styling and layout behavior. Be sure to clearly define breakpoints for responsive behavior using media queries, and ensure padding and spacing adjust appropriately at each size. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files — HTML and CSS. Imagine you're explaining every single element to a student who has never written code before. Comment every tag, class, and rule. Explain what it does, why it’s used, and how it affects the layout or appearance. Include explanations for structure, layout logic, Flexbox/Grid properties, media queries, and responsive behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

      <h1>The Role of Geometry in Abstract Art</h1>
      <!-- Heading for the content topic -->
      <p>
        Abstract art often relies on geometric principles to organize space and guide the viewer's eye. Artists such as Piet Mondrian
        and Kazimir Malevich reduced forms to essential shapes, believing that geometry could reveal universal truths.
        The grid, in particular, became a recurring motif, representing order, balance, and rationality within abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        These geometric systems were not merely aesthetic choices; they reflected philosophical and even spiritual ideals.
        For many modernist artists, reducing the visual language to squares, circles, and triangles was a way of seeking purity in form.
