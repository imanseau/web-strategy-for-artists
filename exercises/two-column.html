      <h1>The Power of Color in Abstract Expressionism</h1>
      <p>
        Abstract Expressionism emerged in the mid-20th century as a radical shift from traditional painting methods. Artists like Mark Rothko and Helen Frankenthaler used bold swaths of color to evoke deep emotional responses rather than depict realistic forms. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus moved away from the subject and toward the feeling it provoked. Warm hues like crimson and orange could convey passion or intensity, while cool blues and grays often evoked introspection or melancholy. The absence of figures allowed color and composition to speak directly to the viewer's subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern artists continue to explore the psychological effects of color through abstract work, using large canvases and layered paint techniques. This legacy reminds us that sometimes whatâ€™s most powerful in art is not what it shows, but what it makes us feel.
