<!--
Create a complete HTML5 page named anchor-links.html that features a sticky navigation bar fixed to the top of the screen. This nav bar should contain anchor links that jump to four different sections within the same page. Each section should have a unique ID and enough vertical content to clearly demonstrate scrolling behavior. Implement smooth scrolling using CSS, and style the entire layout using an external stylesheet at css/anchor-links.css. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <h2>Origins of Color Field Painting</h2>
    <p>Color Field Painting emerged in the late 1940s and 1950s, characterized by large expanses of color covering the entire canvas. Artists sought to eliminate figurative content and instead evoke emotional response through form and color alone.</p>
    <p>Inspired by Abstract Expressionism, it focused more on atmosphere and tone than gesture. Early pioneers like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman emphasized the contemplative effect of layered hues and soft edges.</p>
    <p>It was both a reaction to and evolution of the chaotic brushwork that preceded it, introducing a more meditative visual language.</p>

    <h2>Key Artists</h2>
    <p>Mark Rothko is perhaps the most iconic Color Field painter. His canvases are known for their hazy rectangles of color, intended to elicit deep emotional and spiritual contemplation.</p>
    <p>Barnett Newman used vertical lines—what he called “zips”—to divide his fields of color and encourage direct physical engagement with the canvas. Helen Frankenthaler introduced soak-stain techniques, which influenced many contemporaries.</p>
    <p>These artists helped define a new relationship between the viewer and the canvas—one grounded in feeling rather than narrative.</p>

  <section id="section3">
    <h2>Techniques and Materials</h2>
    <p>Unlike the gestural brushstrokes of Action Painting, Color Field works often used staining, pouring, or spray techniques. This allowed pigments to soak into unprimed canvas, creating soft edges and depth without defined outlines.</p>
    <p>Materials included diluted oil paints and later acrylics, which absorbed differently into the fibers of canvas. The goal was to remove the artist’s hand as much as possible to allow pure color to speak for itself.</p>
    <p>The process was about immersion, both for the artist and the viewer, with works often enveloping entire walls in gallery settings.</p>

    <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
    <p>Color Field Painting influenced generations of minimalists and conceptual artists. Its emotional depth, reliance on scale, and use of simplified form continues to resonate in contemporary installation and environmental art.</p>
    <p>Later artists such as Anish Kapoor and James Turrell extend these principles into three-dimensional or experiential forms—relying on color, perception, and space to evoke meaning.</p>
    <p>Today, Color Field’s legacy persists in digital art, virtual reality, and immersive environments that foreground tone and mood over content and representation.</p>
