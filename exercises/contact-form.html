<!--
Create a complete HTML5 page named contact-form.html that contains a styled contact form using https://formsubmit.co/ as the form action destination. The form should include labeled fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button. Visibly prompt the user to enter their own email address with a placeholder (e.g., "you@example.com") and label ("Enter your email to receive a reply"). Use an input element with type="email" to ensure validation. Add a hidden input field named _honey to trap spam bots, and include another hidden field _captcha set to true to enable CAPTCHA protection. No backend functionality is needed beyond what FormSubmit provides. Style all layout, spacing, padding, labels, and alignment using an external CSS file located at css/contact-form.css. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
