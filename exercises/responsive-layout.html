Prompt:
Create a page with three side-by-side content sections on desktop that stack vertically on mobile. Use background colors and media queries in css/responsive.css to handle the layout shift. Include clear comments to describe how the layout changes at different screen sizes. Write detailed comments for each section of the HTML and CSS code, make the comments for a person who knows nothing about the code. Make up full text to fill out the page about an art topic of your choice.

      <h2>Material Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Contemporary sculptors work with everything from bronze to found objects and digital fabrication. The choice of material is as much a message as the form itself—concrete might suggest industrial themes, while organic fibers evoke the natural world.

    <!-- Second content block -->
    <section class="section section-two">
      <h2>Form and Space</h2>
      <p>
        Modern sculpture often emphasizes negative space—the empty areas within or around the piece. Artists like Barbara Hepworth used pierced forms to integrate their sculptures with the surrounding environment and invite viewers to look through, not just at, the work.

    <!-- Third content block -->
    <section class="section section-three">
      <h2>Public Engagement</h2>
      <p>
        Many sculptors today create work intended for public interaction. Whether through scale, touchable surfaces, or social commentary, these pieces break the "look but don’t touch" rule and aim to involve the audience directly in the artistic experience.
