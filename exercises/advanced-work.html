<!--
You are an AI website generator. Generate a complete, responsive HTML5 page named advanced-work.html, along with a linked external CSS file: css/advanced-work.css. Follow the instructions below exactly.

Filename: advanced-work.html
Concept: This is a detail page for a single artwork. It must present a 3D model viewer on the left, and structured metadata on the right, in a clean, responsive two-column layout.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Header and Footer:

Include a consistent <header> and <footer> structure.

These may contain placeholder navigation, site title, or footer info, reused across the site.

Main Content Layout:

Inside the <main> tag, create a two-column layout.

Use a container such as <div class="work-container"> to hold the two columns.

Left Column (~60-70% width on desktop):

Include a fully functional <model-viewer> element.

Set src="https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb".

Enable camera controls and auto-rotation.

Add alt text and fallback support where possible.

Right Column (~30-40% width on desktop):

Present the following metadata in a clean, readable format using semantic HTML:

Title: Placeholder Title

Artist: Placeholder Artist

Year: Placeholder Year

Medium: Placeholder Medium

Description: a <p> with a paragraph of placeholder (lorem ipsum) text.

Use distinct text styling (e.g., bold labels, normal content) to clearly differentiate each label/value pair.

Responsiveness:

On large screens (desktops ≥ 1024px), maintain the two-column layout.

On smaller screens (tablets and phones < 1024px), stack the layout vertically:

The <model-viewer> appears on top.

Metadata appears below.

Use media queries in the external CSS file to control layout changes.

3D MODEL INTEGRATION:

Use <model-viewer> from https://modelviewer.dev to embed the GLB model.

Load the model from:
https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb

Required attributes:

auto-rotate

camera-controls

ar (to allow augmented reality where supported)

alt="3D model of an astronaut"

Include the <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js"></script> inside the <head> to enable the component.

STYLING INSTRUCTIONS (css/advanced-work.css):

All visual styling must be in css/advanced-work.css. Do not include inline or embedded <style> blocks.

Define column widths, padding, font rules, and responsive behaviors using Flexbox or Grid.

Use consistent, legible typography for all metadata.

Make sure metadata labels (e.g., "Title:") are visually distinct from their values.

Include a breakpoint around 768px–1024px for the mobile/tablet layout shift.

COMMENTING RULES (ALL FILES):

You must include neurotically detailed comments explaining the purpose and reasoning behind every decision:

HTML: Every element, attribute, and structural block must be explained in beginner-friendly terms.

CSS: Each rule must explain:

What selector it targets

Why the property/value was chosen

What visual or layout behavior it affects

PROMPT ARCHIVING:

At the very top of the advanced-work.html file, include this entire prompt inside an HTML comment block so it can be referenced later.

LINK PAGE UPDATE (links.html):

After this page is generated, update the existing links.html page by adding a button or link to the bottom of the existing list of site pages.

Append the following HTML block to links.html:

Link to the advanced work detail page
<a href="advanced-work.html" class="nav-button">Advanced Work Detail</a>
If the links are in a list structure, wrap this in a <li> element or equivalent container.
