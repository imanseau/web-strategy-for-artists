  <p>
    Installation art is a genre that transforms space itself into a medium. Artists design environments that surround the viewer, challenging the traditional boundaries of painting and sculpture. Often temporary and site-specific, these works can dramatically alter how a space is experienced.

  <p>
    From immersive light shows in urban parks to thought-provoking political messages staged in abandoned buildings, installation art redefines audience engagement. It invites people not just to look, but to walk through, listen to, and interact with art in unpredictable ways.
