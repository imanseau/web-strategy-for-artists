<!--
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named button-hover.html that displays a large call-to-action button centered on the screen. Style the button in an external CSS file at css/button-hover.css using a custom background color, rounded corners, appropriate padding, and a smooth hover transition. On hover, change the buttonâ€™s background color to a clearly contrasting or visually engaging alternative. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
