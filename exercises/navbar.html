<!-- 
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named navbar.html with a horizontal <nav> containing links for Home, Gallery, and Contact. Link to an external CSS file (css/navbar.css) that uses Flexbox to evenly space the navigation links across the top of the page. Ask me for a navbar background color and link color before styling. Write detailed comments in both the HTML and CSS files, as if you're teaching someone completely new to coding. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
