    <h1>Installation Art: Immersive Expression</h1>
    <p>
      Installation art transforms space into experience. Artists use environments, objects, and often sound or motion
      to create large-scale works that the audience can walk through or interact with. It’s not about a single object on a wall—
      it’s about the total environment and how it engages the viewer physically and emotionally.
