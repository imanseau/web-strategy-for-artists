        <h1>Advanced Web Exercises</h1>
        <p>
            The following exercises are designed to test your ability to synthesize the concepts you've learned into a single, comprehensive AI prompt. For each exercise, your task is not to write the code yourself, but to write a detailed prompt for an AI that specifies all the required features, layouts, and behaviors. Your prompt should be clear and specific enough for the AI to generate a complete and functional page that meets all the requirements.
        </p>

        <div class="exercise">
            <h3>Advanced Exercise 1: The Artist Bio Page</h3>
            <div class="filename"><strong>Filename:</strong> <code>exercises/advanced-bio.html</code></div>
            <div class="concept"><strong>Concept:</strong> This exercise combines a responsive two-column layout, custom typography, and styled interactive elements to create a professional and engaging artist biography page. It requires you to specify layout, responsive behavior, and visual styling in a single, cohesive prompt.</div>
            <h4>Your Task:</h4>
            <p>Write a single, detailed prompt for an AI that will generate a complete, responsive "Artist Bio" page. Your prompt must instruct the AI to include the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overall Structure:</strong> The page must have a consistent &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout:</strong> The main content area must be a two-column layout on desktop screens.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The left column should contain the image located at <code>exercises/images/sample.jpg</code>.</li>
                        <li>The right column should contain a heading (e.g., "About the Artist") and several paragraphs of placeholder text.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> On smaller screens (e.g., mobile), the two-column layout must collapse into a single column, with the image appearing above the text.</li>
                <li><strong>Typography:</strong> The page must import and use two different fonts from Google Fonts: one for the heading and another for the body text.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Element:</strong> Below the bio text, include a styled call-to-action button (e.g., "View My Work") that links to a placeholder page. The button must have a clear hover effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Styling:</strong> All styling must be in an external CSS file (<code>css/advanced-bio.css</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Commenting:</strong> Your prompt must enforce the "neurotically detailed comments" rule from the introductory exercises, instructing the AI to explain the purpose and reasoning behind every HTML tag and CSS rule.</li>
                <li><strong>Prompt Archiving:</strong> Your prompt must instruct the AI to include the full prompt it receives as a comment block at the top of the main HTML file.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Exercise 2: The Artwork Series Gallery</h3>
            <div class="filename"><strong>Filename:</strong> <code>exercises/advanced-gallery.html</code></div>
            <div class="concept"><strong>Concept:</strong> This exercise focuses on creating a visually appealing and interactive gallery to showcase a series of artworks. It requires you to combine a responsive CSS Grid layout with interactive hover effects and a modal lightbox for viewing images.</div>
            <h4>Your Task:</h4>
            <p>Write a single, detailed prompt for an AI that will generate a complete, responsive "Artwork Series" gallery page. Your prompt must instruct the AI to include the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overall Structure:</strong> The page must have a consistent &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, as well as a main heading that serves as the title of the art series.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid Layout:</strong> The gallery must display the six available images (<code>gallery1.jpg</code> through <code>gallery6.jpg</code> from the <code>exercises/images/</code> folder) in a responsive grid.
                    <ul>
                        <li>On desktop screens, the grid should be three columns.</li>
                        <li>On tablet screens, it should be two columns.</li>
                        <li>On mobile screens, it should be a single column.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hover Effect:</strong> When a user hovers over a gallery image, a semi-transparent overlay containing the placeholder title of the artwork must appear.</li>
                <li><strong>Lightbox/Modal:</strong> When a user clicks on any gallery image, a larger version of that image must open in a centered modal window with a dimmed background. The modal must be closable by either clicking a close button ("X") or by clicking on the background overlay.</li>
                <li><strong>Styling &amp; Functionality:</strong> All styling must be in <code>css/advanced-gallery.css</code>, and all modal functionality must be handled by <code>scripts/advanced-gallery.js</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Commenting:</strong> Your prompt must enforce the "neurotically detailed comments" rule, instructing the AI to explain the purpose and reasoning behind every HTML tag, CSS rule, and JavaScript function.</li>
                <li><strong>Prompt Archiving:</strong> Your prompt must instruct the AI to include the full prompt it receives as a comment block at the top of the main HTML file.</li>

            <div class="concept"><strong>Concept:</strong> This is a capstone exercise that requires you to combine multiple components and concepts from the entire course into a single, cohesive homepage. You will need to specify a sticky header, a hero section, multiple content sections, and responsive behavior for all elements.</div>
            <h4>Your Task:</h4>
            <p>Write a single, detailed prompt for an AI that will generate a complete, responsive homepage. Your prompt must instruct the AI to include all of the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sticky Navigation:</strong> A &lt;header&gt; that is fixed to the top of the screen as the user scrolls.
                    <ul>
                        <li>On desktop, it should display a logo on the left and navigation links on the right.</li>
                        <li>On mobile, the navigation links should collapse into a "hamburger" icon that toggles a dropdown or overlay menu when clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hero Section:</strong> A full-height hero section directly below the navigation bar. It must have a background image using the file at <code>exercises/images/hero.jpg</code> and contain a centered main heading and a call-to-action button.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Sections:</strong> At least two additional content sections below the hero. Examples could include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A short "About Me" section with a brief text intro and a link to the full bio page.</li>
                        <li>A "Featured Work" section displaying a small, responsive grid of 3-4 images (using files like <code>gallery1.jpg</code>, <code>gallery2.jpg</code>, etc.) that link to their respective work pages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Footer:</strong> A &lt;footer&gt; at the bottom of the page containing social media links and a copyright notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactivity (Optional but Encouraged):</strong> Specify the use of subtle scroll-reveal animations to have content sections fade in as they enter the viewport.</li>
                <li><strong>Styling &amp; Functionality:</strong> All styling must be in <code>css/advanced-homepage.css</code>, and all interactive functionality (like the mobile menu) must be in <code>scripts/advanced-homepage.js</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Commenting:</strong> Your prompt must enforce the "neurotically detailed comments" rule, instructing the AI to explain the purpose and reasoning behind every HTML tag, CSS rule, and JavaScript function.</li>
                <li><strong>Prompt Archiving:</strong> Your prompt must instruct the AI to include the full prompt it receives as a comment block at the top of the main HTML file.</li>
