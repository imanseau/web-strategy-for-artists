<!--
  Create a complete HTML5 page named scroll-reveal.html with at least five vertically stacked 
  content sections. Each section should contain a heading and paragraph of placeholder content 
  about an art topic. Apply a scroll-triggered animation (such as fade-in or slide-up) to each 
  section using JavaScript and CSS. Use the Intersection Observer API in an external JavaScript 
  file at scripts/scroll-reveal.js to detect when each section enters the viewport. When a section 
  is visible, add a CSS class that triggers a transition. Write all styling and animation behavior 
  in an external stylesheet at css/scroll-reveal.css. Ensure animations are subtle, accessible, 
  and trigger progressively as the user scrolls—not all at once or just at the end. 
  Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, 
  and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. 
  Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. 
  Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Renaissance</h2>
    <p>
      Marking a rebirth of classical knowledge and humanism, Renaissance art emphasized proportion, perspective,
      and anatomical precision. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo redefined realism in painting and sculpture.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Baroque</h2>
    <p>
      Emerging in 17th-century Europe, Baroque art was characterized by dramatic lighting, emotional intensity,
      and grandeur. Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Bernini created works that engaged viewers physically and emotionally.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Impressionism</h2>
    <p>
      Challenging academic traditions, Impressionist painters like Monet and Degas captured fleeting moments using light,
      loose brushwork, and outdoor settings. The movement emphasized perception over perfection.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Surrealism</h2>
    <p>
      Influenced by psychoanalysis and dreams, Surrealist artists like Dalí and Magritte explored the subconscious mind
      through bizarre, illogical imagery that blurred the boundaries between reality and imagination.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Contemporary Art</h2>
    <p>
      Contemporary art defies clear definitions, encompassing conceptual, digital, and interdisciplinary practices.
      It often engages with social, political, and environmental issues, pushing the limits of medium and message.
