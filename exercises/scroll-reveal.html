<!--
  Create a complete HTML5 page named scroll-reveal.html that displays at least four vertically stacked 
  content sections, each with a heading and a paragraph about an art topic. As the user scrolls down, 
  each section should animate into view (e.g., fade in or slide up). Use the Intersection Observer API 
  in an external JavaScript file at scripts/scroll-reveal.js to detect when each section enters the viewport. 
  Apply animation effects by toggling a CSS class. Write all visual styling in an external stylesheet located 
  at css/scroll-reveal.css, using CSS transitions for smooth visual behavior. Ensure animations are subtle, 
  accessible, and don’t interfere with reading. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain 
  every tag, class, transition, timing function, and JavaScript logic as if you're walking a complete beginner 
  through it line by line. Include named comments describing your visual hierarchy and interaction goals. 
  Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <p>Scroll down to explore key movements in 20th and 21st century visual culture.</p>
  </header>

  <!-- === Section 1 === -->
  <section class="reveal-section">
    <h2>Abstract Expressionism</h2>
    <p>
      Rooted in post-WWII America, this movement emphasized spontaneous brushwork, emotional intensity,
      and the subconscious. Artists like Jackson Pollock and Helen Frankenthaler redefined painting as gesture.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- === Section 2 === -->
  <section class="reveal-section">
    <h2>Pop Art</h2>
    <p>
      Pop Art emerged in the 1950s-60s as a response to mass media and consumer culture. 
      Using images from advertising and comics, artists like Warhol and Lichtenstein blurred the line between high and low art.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- === Section 3 === -->
  <section class="reveal-section">
    <h2>Minimalism</h2>
    <p>
      In stark contrast to expressive movements, Minimalism focused on repetition, clean forms, 
      and industrial materials. Artists like Donald Judd prioritized the object over symbolism.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- === Section 4 === -->
  <section class="reveal-section">
    <h2>Digital & New Media</h2>
    <p>
      Encompassing internet art, generative design, and interactive installations, 
      this field reflects how technology reshapes aesthetics, authorship, and audience engagement.
