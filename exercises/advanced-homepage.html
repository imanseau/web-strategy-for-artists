<!--
You are an AI website builder. Generate a complete, responsive HTML5 homepage named advanced-homepage.html, along with two linked external files:

css/advanced-homepage.css for all styling

scripts/advanced-homepage.js for all interactivity

Follow these specifications precisely:

Filename: advanced-homepage.html
Concept: This is a capstone homepage that combines sticky navigation, a hero section, content sections, a responsive layout, and interactivity into one cohesive entry point for an artist’s website.

PAGE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Sticky Header with Navigation:

Create a <header> element that is fixed to the top of the screen using CSS.

Inside the header:

On desktop screens:

The site name (e.g., “Your Name”) appears on the left as plain text or a logo placeholder.

A set of navigation links (e.g., Home, About, Work, Contact) appears on the right, laid out horizontally.

On mobile screens:

The navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu.

When the hamburger is clicked, a dropdown menu or fullscreen overlay should appear with the same navigation links.

The mobile menu toggle must be fully functional using JavaScript in scripts/advanced-homepage.js.

Hero Section:

Place a <section class="hero"> directly below the header.

It must be full viewport height (100vh) and span the full width.

The background must use the image at images/hero.jpg via CSS background-image.

In the center of the hero section, include:

A large <h1> headline with placeholder text (e.g., "Welcome to My Portfolio").

A prominent call-to-action button (e.g., "View My Work") that links to advanced-gallery.html.

Content Sections:

Below the hero section, create at least two well-structured sections:

About Me Section:

A short heading and a paragraph of placeholder text.

A text or button link to advanced-bio.html labeled "Read More" or similar.

Featured Work Section:

A responsive image grid displaying 3 to 4 artworks (use gallery1.jpg, gallery2.jpg, etc.).

Each image should link to a relevant detail page or placeholder.

The layout should adapt for desktop, tablet, and mobile using media queries.

Each section should be visually distinct using padding, background colors, or separators.

Footer:

Include a <footer> at the bottom of the page.

It must contain:

Social media icon links (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, or placeholders).

A copyright notice.

Optional Interactivity (Encouraged):

Implement scroll-triggered animations (such as fade-ins) so that content sections appear smoothly as the user scrolls down.

This should be implemented with lightweight JavaScript in scripts/advanced-homepage.js, and work without external libraries.

Each animated section must degrade gracefully on browsers without JavaScript.

RESPONSIVENESS REQUIREMENTS:

The entire layout must be responsive:

Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layouts.

Use media queries to adjust breakpoints for:

Large screens (≥1024px)

Tablet (768–1023px)

Mobile (<768px)

Ensure the sticky nav, hero layout, grid, and footer all adapt cleanly.

FILE ORGANIZATION:

advanced-homepage.html — the main homepage

css/advanced-homepage.css — all styling rules

scripts/advanced-homepage.js — all functionality (e.g., hamburger menu, scroll-reveal)

DO NOT use any inline or embedded styles or scripts.

COMMENTING RULES:

Use neurotically detailed comments in all three files:

HTML:

Explain every tag, structural block, and attribute.

State why each section exists and how it contributes to the user experience.

CSS:

Explain each selector, rule, and value.

Justify layout decisions, media queries, animations, spacing, and responsive design patterns.

JavaScript:

Comment every function, event listener, conditional, and DOM manipulation.

Explain why the code works and how it supports responsive or interactive behavior.

These comments should be instructional for a beginning web developer.

PROMPT ARCHIVING:

At the very top of the advanced-homepage.html file, include the full contents of this prompt as a multi-line HTML comment block. This is required for future review or instruction.

LINKS PAGE UPDATE:

After generating this page, update links.html by adding a button or link to this new homepage at the bottom of the list.
Append the following HTML to links.html:
Link to the advanced homepage
<a href="advanced-homepage.html" class="nav-button">Advanced Homepage</a>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that supports most languages.
  -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag ensures the page is responsive and scales correctly on all devices.
    width=device-width sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device.
    initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level.
  -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-LSL8HVD4LB"></script>
  <script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-LSL8HVD4LB');
  </script>
  <!--
    The <title> tag sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.
  -->
  <title>Advanced Homepage | Artist Portfolio</title>
  <!--
    Link to the external CSS stylesheet for all visual styling and layout.
    Keeping CSS external improves maintainability and separation of concerns.
  -->
