<!--
  Create a complete HTML5 page named loading.html that displays a centered loading animation 
  or spinner on the screen. Use pure CSS to animate the spinner using @keyframes for either 
  rotation or pulsing. The animation should run continuously to indicate loading. 
  Style everything using an external stylesheet located at css/loading.css. 
  The page should be minimal but visually clear, with the spinner centered both vertically 
  and horizontally. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, 
  class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the 
  reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color 
  scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the 
  HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.
