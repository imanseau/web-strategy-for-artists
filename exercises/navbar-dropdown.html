Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page with a horizontal <nav> bar. On the left, include a branding element (such as a site name or logo).
On the right, add navigation links: Home, Gallery, Contact, and a dropdown menu labeled "More" with two additional links inside it.
Use Flexbox in css/navbar-dropdown.css to space the branding and links appropriately.
Use a small amount of JavaScript in scripts/navbar-dropdown.js to toggle the visibility of the dropdown links when "More" is clicked.
Ask me for a navbar background color and link color before styling.
Write detailed comments in all the files, imagine you're explaining it to someone new to coding.
Include this prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file.
Add filler content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <h1>AI-Generated Sculpture</h1>
    <p>
      Sculptors are now collaborating with artificial intelligence to co-create art.
      Using machine learning models trained on form, movement, and material behaviors, artists generate 3D shapes that are printed or cast into physical sculptures.
      These hybrid works push the limits of authorship and challenge what it means to design in the age of algorithms.
