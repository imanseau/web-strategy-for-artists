<!-- 
Prompt:
Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named navbar-dropdown.html with a horizontal <nav> bar. On the left, include a branding element such as a site name or logo. On the right, add navigation links for Home, Gallery, and Contact, along with a dropdown menu labeled “More” that contains two additional links. Link to an external CSS file (css/navbar-dropdown.css) that uses Flexbox to space the branding and navigation links appropriately. Make sure the dropdown menu is fully visible and not clipped by any overflow or positioning issues—use absolute positioning and a clear parent container if needed. Use a small amount of JavaScript in scripts/navbar-dropdown.js to toggle the visibility of the dropdown links when “More” is clicked. Ask me for a navbar background color and link color before styling. Write detailed comments in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as if you're teaching someone completely new to coding. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <h1>Using Light as Material</h1>
    <p>
      Contemporary artists are increasingly treating light not just as illumination but as a sculptural medium. This shift transforms both space and perception.
