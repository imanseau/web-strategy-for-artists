	<h1>Web Concept Exercises</h1>
	<p>All of the following exercises will be created using AI prompts, not hand-coded. Each file should be saved inside a folder called <code>exercises/</code>. These pages are designed to isolate specific building blocks of modern web development; from layout and typography to navigation, interactivity, and responsiveness. Your goal is not just to make functional web pages, but to learn how to communicate effectively with an AI tool to produce clear, efficient, and well-structured code. Each exercise teaches you something new about web design, but also about prompt construction, the art of getting exactly what you need by describing it precisely. Pay close attention to the prompt before you run it, it’s a contract between you and the AI. Read it as if it were written for a freelance developer: are the instructions clear, complete, and specific? Does it describe not only what you want to appear on the page, but also how it should behave and why? After generating each file, study the resulting code carefully. The AI will include neurotically detailed comments explaining every line, use them. Read through the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand how each piece fits together. Don't just glance at what shows up in the browser, examine the underlying structure and logic. This process will train you to see code not just as output, but as a readable, editable language, one you’ll be fluent in by the time you build your full portfolio site.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Structure & Layout</h2>
		<p>This section focuses on how web pages are structured using HTML5’s semantic elements, such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. You’ll explore how to organize content into logical blocks and use layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid to control spacing and alignment. Pay close attention to how the prompts describe page organization, are sections named clearly? Is spacing handled with CSS rather than brute force? Read through the AI-generated code and comments to understand the role each tag plays and how visual structure is achieved with external stylesheets. This section builds the foundation for everything that follows.</p>
	
		<div class="exercise">
			<h3>Basic HTML Page</h3>
			<div class="filename"><strong>Filename:</strong> <a href="basic.html">exercises/basic.html</a></div>
			<div class="concept">
			<strong>Concept:</strong> Headings, paragraphs, boilerplate, external CSS. This is your starting point for understanding how a modern HTML5 document is constructed. The exercise introduces the basic structure of a webpage: the DOCTYPE declaration, the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, and nested <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections. It also introduces semantic elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for structuring content, and external stylesheets for keeping visual design separate from structure. Carefully read the AI-generated comments in both the HTML and CSS files. These annotations explain not just *what* each part does, but *why* it’s there and how it connects to best practices. Pay attention to file linking, page titles, and text alignment — these are all fundamentals that future pages will build on.
			</div>
			<div class="prompt">
				<span class="prompt-label">Prompt:</span>Create a complete HTML5 page named <code>basic.html</code>. Add a centered &lt;h1&gt; heading and a short &lt;p&gt; paragraph.

			<h3>Parallax Page</h3>
			<div class="filename"><strong>Filename:</strong> <a href="parallax.html">exercises/parallax.html</a></div>
			<div class="concept"><strong>Concept:</strong> This project explores parallax scrolling as a technique to create visual depth by layering fixed background images behind scrollable content. You’ll combine multiple sections—some with solid backgrounds and some with background images that stay fixed as the user scrolls—to simulate movement and spatial layering. Key concepts include viewport-based height control, use of <code>background-attachment: fixed</code>, content padding for readability, and how contrasting visual treatments can guide user attention. This is essential for creating immersive, professional-looking pages with strong design hierarchy.</div>
			<div class="prompt">
				<span class="prompt-label">Prompt:</span>Create a complete HTML5 page named <code>parallax.html</code> that demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect using multiple sections. Use a combination of solid-colored and parallax-image sections to create clear visual contrast as the user scrolls. Structure the layout with the following sequence: (1) a solid background section with a large heading as the page title (let the height be <code>auto</code> based on content), (2) a parallax section using <code>images/parallax.jpg</code> set to 25% of the viewport height, (3) a solid section with a heading and at least three paragraphs discussing an art-related topic, (4) another parallax section at 10% viewport height, and (5) a final solid section with additional paragraph content. Style everything using <code>css/parallax.css</code>, and use <code>background-attachment: fixed</code> in the parallax sections. Ensure text is readable and well-padded. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file.
